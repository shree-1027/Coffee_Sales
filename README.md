â˜• Coffee Sales Dashboard Project
This project presents an end-to-end data analysis workflow involving data cleaning, transformation, querying, and dashboard creation. The goal is to derive business insights from coffee sales data using tools like Python, SQL, and Power BI.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
â€¢	Excel â€“ Initial data exploration

â€¢	Python (Pandas) â€“ Data cleaning and preprocessing

â€¢	SQL â€“ Data querying and transformation

â€¢	Power BI â€“ Data visualization and dashboard design

ðŸ“Œ Project Steps
1. Data Acquisition
    Raw data was provided in Excel/CSV format containing details about coffee sales, including coffee names, prices, locations, dates, and payment methods.

2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python)
    Using Python libraries like pandas, the following tasks were performed:
    â€¢	Handled missing or inconsistent values.

    â€¢	Converted data types (dates, numeric fields).

    â€¢	Removed duplicates.

    This step was similar to Excel preprocessing but more efficient and scalable using Python.

3. SQL-Based Data Querying
    After cleaning, the dataset was exported and loaded into a SQL environment for structured querying. Some tasks included:
    â€¢	Aggregating sales by coffee type, store, and date.

    â€¢	Calculating total and average sales.

    â€¢	Filtering based on payment methods and customer types.

    â€¢	Identifying peak sales hours and best-performing locations.

4. Power BI Dashboard
    The final, cleaned dataset was imported into Power BI to create an interactive dashboard. It includes:
    â€¢	Overall sales performance metrics.

    â€¢	Time-based analysis (hourly, daily, and weekly trends).

    â€¢	Coffee-wise and store-wise breakdown.

    â€¢	Customer segmentation and payment mode preferences.

    â€¢	Slicers for filtering by coffee name, store, customer type, and more.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Business Insights
â€¢	Identification of top-selling coffee types and stores.

â€¢	Peak business hours and high-performing days.

â€¢	Customer preferences by payment mode and product.

â€¢	Store-specific revenue contributions.

â€¢	Overall sales trends across time.

âœ… Outcome
This project showcases how raw business data can be transformed into actionable insights through a systematic approach using data tools. It combines data engineering, analytics, and visualization to provide a clear view of operational performance and customer behavior.
